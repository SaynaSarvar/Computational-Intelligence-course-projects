## üß† Project Descriptions

### 1. **NeuralNetwork_MNIST**
- A simple feedforward neural network implemented from scratch (or using PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- Trained on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.

### 2. **GeneticAlgorithm_TSP**
- A genetic algorithm used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- Includes mutation, crossover, and selection mechanisms.

### 3. **FuzzyLogic_Controller**
- An implementation of a fuzzy controller for a system (e.g., temperature control).
- Demonstrates fuzzy rule base, membership functions, and inference engine.

### 4. **PSO_NeuralNet_Training**
- A neural network trained using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) instead of traditional gradient descent.
- Shows performance comparison between training methods.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for some neural net projects)
- Scikit-learn
- Custom implementations (no library)

## üìå Notes

- Each project contains its own README with more details.
- This repo is educational and demonstrates core concepts in computational intelligence.
