# üß† Computational Intelligence Projects (JavaScript)

This repository contains a collection of educational projects developed for the **Computational Intelligence** course taught by **Professor Kohestani** at **University of Tabriz**.

All projects were implemented in **pure JavaScript**, **without any external machine learning libraries**, as part of coursework during the **fifth semester** of the undergraduate program.
