# 🧠 Computational Intelligence Projects

This repository contains a collection of student projects developed for the **Computational Intelligence** course taught by **Professor Kohestani**.

These projects cover a range of topics in **neural networks** and **evolutionary algorithms**, implemented from scratch using Python. Each folder represents a separate hands-on assignment demonstrating key algorithms in the field.
