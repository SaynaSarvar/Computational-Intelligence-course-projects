# üß† Computational Intelligence Projects (JavaScript)

This repository contains a collection of educational projects developed for the **Computational Intelligence** course taught by **Professor Kohestani** at **University of Tabriz**.

All projects are implemented in **pure JavaScript**, without using any machine learning libraries. Each project demonstrates a fundamental concept in neural networks or evolutionary algorithms.
